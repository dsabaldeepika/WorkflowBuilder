"Design a comprehensive set of workflow templates for 'PumpFlux' focused on Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and related business processes, inspired by the attached image.

For each of the following scenarios, outline the workflow logic, necessary app integrations, and potential user benefits:

1.  **Save new Facebook Lead Ads leads into Google Sheets.**
2.  **Send a Gmail message from a Facebook Lead Ads form submission.**
3.  **Send a Slack message from a Facebook Lead Ads form submission.**
4.  **Create new completions with OpenAI ChatGPT from new rows in Google Sheets.** (Expand on this - what kind of completions? e.g., summarizing lead info, generating follow-up questions).
5.  **Create new completions with Anthropic Claude from new rows in Google Sheets.** (Same expansion as above).
6.  **AI web scraping of Anthropic Claude and Google Sheets.** (Detail what kind of data would be scraped and how it integrates with Google Sheets).
7.  **Send a Slack message from a new HubSpot CRM deal.**
8.  **Send a Slack message from a new HubSpot CRM form submission.**
9.  **Create ClickUp tasks from new HubSpot CRM contacts.**
10. **Update a record in HubSpot CRM by records from Airtable form.**
11. **Create a PandaDoc document when a HubSpot CRM deal stage changes.**
12. **Send Slack messages for new Pipedrive activities.**
13. **Add new Pipedrive deals to a Google Sheets spreadsheet as new rows.**
14. **Add new Google Forms responses to Pipedrive as deals.**
15. **Create Mailchimp subscribers from new Google Sheets rows.**
16. **Create Trello cards from new Salesforce tasks.**
17. **Create ClickUp tasks from new opportunities in Salesforce.**
18. **Send a Slack message from a closed Salesforce opportunity.**

**Additionally, for each template idea above, consider and suggest:**

* **Customization Options:** What parts of the workflow would a user likely want to customize?
* **Potential Enhancements:** How could these workflows be made even more powerful (e.g., adding filters, conditional logic, multi-step actions)?
* **Use Cases:** Briefly describe a scenario where a business would find this template particularly useful.
